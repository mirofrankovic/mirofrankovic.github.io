VaniliaLemon | A Student House <br />

This is a 'digital framework' I have developed for my project. It is a front-end website that provides a basic information for students seeking a private accomodation in Manchester with:

1. Details of what to expext from us
2. A map showing where the accomodation is situated
3. A gallery of images of our accomodation we offer for our potential customer
4. A form to send
5. A basic information for students included our basic policy and terms of conditions

DEMO <br />

A demo of this site is available <a href="index.html">here</a>

This app is hosted by GitHub Pages, a static site hosting service which supports client-side code. It does not support server-side code in languages like PHP or Python.

<li>If you wish to run this site locally, please clone or download this repo. You can then run index.html or open index.html in your browser.</li>
<li>If you wish to deploy a live version of this site, then you will need to create your own GitHub repo. Navigate to settings and enable GitHub Pages by setting the Source to master branch.

BUILT WITH <br />
